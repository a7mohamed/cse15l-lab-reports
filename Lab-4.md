# Hello, this is my blog for Lab Report 4.
I'm going to go over my exact process on completing the Week 7 lab's 10 step process, but I will only document what I press from steps 4 to 9. Let's go!

Step 4 tells me to log into ieng6, so that's what I'll do first. This is what I typed into the terminal:
```
ssh cs15lwi23ako@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
