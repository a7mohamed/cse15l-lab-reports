# Hello, this is my blog for Lab Report 2.
So the first part of this Lab Report asks us to write a webserver called StringServer that keeps track of a single string that gets added to by incoming requests. My code looks like this:

When you type in mulitple strings, they should be printed on separate lines. It should look like this:

In the duration of this code running, many methods are called. We can see methods like getPath() and getQuery() which are built in java commands that come from the import java.net.URI.
