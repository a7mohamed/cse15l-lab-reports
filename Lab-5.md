# Hello, this is my blog for Lab Report 5.

For this lab, we get to choose a favorite lab report of ours and try to complete them in a different way. Personally, my favorite lab was lab report 3 because we were able to go a little deeper into on of the three commands we had learned then: grep, find and less. I chose to go deeper into the grep command, but this time, I want to go learn more about the find command.

So first off, let's go over one of the most noticeable find commands: "find <directory> -name <filename>". This command finds files in the specified directory with the 
given filename. Here's how it works:

I've decided to look into the berlitz1/ file and search for any file that ends in .txt (which is what the *.txt means), and it found many files that end in .txt (it showed more but I only screenshotted a couple).

Next, let's look at another command that could be very useful: "find <directory> -print". This command prints the filenames of the files found by the find command. This option is used by default if no other action is specified.
