# Hello, this is my blog for Lab Report 3.
I will be showing some examples of ways you can use the grep command in the command line.
I will be writing my examples in my java terminal using bash.

When grep is executed, it searches for the specified pattern in each line of the input file or standard input. If a line matches the pattern, grep prints the line to standard output by default.

For our first example, I will be showing you two examples of me using the command grep -c.
What grep -c does is that instead of returning the lines of the words grep finds, it return the how many times they were found. Here's an example of me using grep normally, and then grep -c after.
