# Hello, this is my blog for Lab 1.
Ok, so the first thing we were told to do was to download VSCODE. After clicking the link and installing it, you should see a page that looks like this.

Once you have that installed and you see this, the next thing you want to do is open up your terminal which is located on the top left of the screen, or you can press the keys CTRL + SHIFT + ` (Don't include the pluses).
While your terminal is open, you are going to want to connect to the remote server by using your course specific account for CSE 15L. To find your course specific account info, click this [link](http://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php).
Once you have your account name, type ssh yourusername@ieng6.ucsd.edu where yourusername is your course specific account name. It should look something like this when you've connected.
